A multi-asset stock trading game is now available at [nvesto.io](https://www.nvesto.io). Feel free to register and play/trade.

### Principles of the game 

1. The game is currently completely free of charge. To participate in the game you need to create an account, by providing your name, email address, and creating a password. You will need to confirm your email address, and upon a successful registration you will be assigned a unique account number and password. 

2. When you create an account you will receive some cash and some shares of stocks. Cash on Nvesto Stock Exchange is denominated in the currency called Citrine. In the currently operated free version of the game Citrine is denoted as CTRn, and is not convertible to any other currency. In the future we are planning to upgrade Nvesto Stock Exchange to the paid version, and then the Citrine holdings (denoted as CTRN) will be convertible to USD at a fixed exchange rate. All the cash holdings, stock prices, and portfolio values on Nvesto Stock Exchange are quoted in units of Citrine.

3. The goal of the game is to make as much Citrine as possible by trading stocks. The essential skill required to systematically succeed in this game is to be able to predict how the prices of the stocks are going to behave. You don't have to be accurate a hundred percent of the time, but you need to be able to win more than lose.

4. Prices of the stocks are determined exclusively by an intersection of the aggregate supply and demand for each stock, created by the traders on Nvesto Stock Exchange.

5. An extra kick of the game is the _sentiment news_. The sentiment news (sentiments) are stochastically generated news related to the Nvesto stocks. These news pop up randomly once in a while on the Nvesto website, and are visible to the users when they select a stock for a trade on the Order page. The timing of the sentiments is not predictable. Each trader needs to decide how the sentiments are going to influence their trading strategy. However, the subtlety is that the traders need to guess how the **majority** of the traders are going to react to the sentiments, because that will influence how the prices of the stocks are going to move.

6. Nvesto offers a possibility to incorporate both the fundamental analysis (based on the sentiments) and the technicagl analysis into the trading strategy. For the latter Nvesto Stock Exchange supplies the users with the real-time stock prices and the historical price records, and provides the moving average indicators of the stock prices.

The backend of the website is remarkably straightforward. Stock orders are recorded in the order books and are filled by matching engine, searching for the best bid and the best ask prices, as well as prioritizing in the first come first served order of execution.
